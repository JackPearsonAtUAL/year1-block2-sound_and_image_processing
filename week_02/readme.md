# Week 2: Manipulating and Analysing Pixels

## Directory contents

* Code sample for the colorswap, histogram and video examples are in `examples/`

## Week 2 Portfolio Task, part 1.

1. Open the histogram sketch. It's a script which converts a photo into black and white, and shows a histogram of brightness.
Working in pairs - as a Driver and Navigator - try to adapt the code so that it shows the image in its original colour, and then show three histograms: one for each of the R, G, B channels.
2. Try it with a different image of your choice.
3. Advanced: Make a copy of the sketch, swap colour channels, and display histograms for those.

## Week 2 Portfolio Task, part 2.

1. Have a look at this blog post on glitch art made by pixel sorting:
https://glitchology.com/pixel-sorting/
2. Make your own piece of glitch art and document it in your portfolio. You're encouraged to experiment with multiple versions and approaches.

**You're welcome to use the code from the post as a starter, but please pick a different rule for sorting pixels.**
